### Course Objectives

This class is an introduction to server-side Web development using the most current Web server technologies. General Web development principles such as usability, reliability, maintainability and scalability will be applied to current Web development environments. Students will gain real-world experience in creating Websites for multiple Web platforms.

### Course Delivery 

Class will consist of a mix of lecture, demonstrations, student discussions, labs and homework related to the responsibilities and activities of the PHP Developer. Questions and comments during class time are encouraged (and participation is encouraged). Programming concepts will be illustrated in class using live demonstrations and discussions. It is expected that students will have read the assigned materials prior to the class discussions. Open Lab time, in class, will be provided as time permits.

### Cell Phones 

For obvious reasons, cell phones should be set to silent or vibrate during class. If you must take a phone call, please excuse yourself from the classroom. 

### Surfing the Net (and other inappropriate behavior) during class 

Please don't waste my time or yours by surfing the internet, playing video games, instant messaging, working on assignments from other classes, etc., while class is in session. It distracts me and other students. 

### Accommodations

"Any student requiring accommodations or services due to a disability must contact Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) in room 181 of the Student Services Center. SSD can also arrange to provide course materials (including the syllabus) in alternative formats if necessary." For more information about the SSD contact them at 801-626-6413, ssd@weber.edu, or http://departments.weber.edu/ssd 

### Canvas

### Course Fee Statement

Course fees for the Computer Science major are designed to cover the costs of lab equipment maintenance and replacement including desktop and server computer systems and software; consumable materials and supplies; and support for lab aides, student tutors, and online instructional resources.

### Honesty Policy

CS Department policy dictates that any verifiable evidence of student academic cheating, as defined and determined by the instructor, will result in:

1. an automatic failing grade for the class and

2. a report to the Dean of Students that will include the student's name and a description of the student's dishonest conduct.

What constitutes cheating? As per the WSU Student Code in the PPM:

The following activities are specifically prohibited:

  a. Cheating, which includes but is not limited to:

    i) Copying from another student's test;

    ii) Using materials during a test not authorized by the person giving the test; iii) Collaborating with any other person during a test without authorization;

    iv) Knowingly obtaining, using, buying, selling, transporting, or soliciting in whole or in part the contents of any test without authorization of the appropriate University official

    v) Bribing any other person to obtain any test;

    vi) Soliciting or receiving unauthorized information about any test;

    vii) Substituting for another student or permitting any other person to substitute for oneself to take a test.

  b. Plagiarism, which is the unacknowledged (uncited) use of any other person’s or group’s ideas or work. This includes purchased or borrowed papers;

  c. Collusion, which is the unauthorized collaboration with another person in preparing work offered for credit;

  d. Falsification, which is the intentional and unauthorized altering or inventing of any information or citation in an academic exercise, activity, or record-keeping process; e. Giving, selling, or receiving unauthorized course or test information;

  f. Using any unauthorized resource or aid in the preparation or completion of any course work, exercise, or activity;

  g. Infringing on the copyright law of the United States which prohibits the making of reproductions of copyrighted material except under certain specified conditions.

### Academic Cheating Policy

CS policy dictates that any verifiable evidence of student academic cheating, as defined and determined by the instructor, will result in: 1) an automatic failing grade for the class and 2) a report to the Dean of Students that will include the student's name and a description of the student's dishonest conduct.

### Complaining About Grades 

I recognize and encourage a student's sacred right to complain about their grade. There are, however, a few rules under which such complaining should take place, and those students who don't follow the rules will be less successful in their complaints than those students who do follow the rules. 

First, the only complaint that matters is that something got marked wrong when it was actually right. When you come to complain, be prepared to present, in explicit detail, what it is you did and why you think it is right. 

Second, complaints about a particular test or assignment are only valid until the next test or assignment is due; after that point the book is permanently closed on all previous test or assignment grades.
